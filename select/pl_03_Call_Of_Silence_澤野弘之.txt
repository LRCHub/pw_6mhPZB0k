I'm ready to dive
Where nothing's alive
But my own reality
I'm ready to fall
Where nothing is all
Where all is clear to me
I don't need you to deceive
The senses I rely upon
Don't incite me to betray my
conscience
I will overcome
I'll make no compromise
You won't stop me... I will
curse the bane
I'll face the worm that never
dies
I will trample it and call the
rain
I'll make no compromise
Roots of lies i'll eradicate
I'll make no compromise
Through silence i will
peregrinate
I'm ready to dive
Where nothing's alive
But my own reality
I'm ready to fall
Where nothing is all
Where all is clear to me
What i need is to bring
everything
Into oblivion
Within me there is the only
place
Where i can see the sun
I'll make no compromise
You won't stop me... I will
curse the bane
I'll face the worm that never
dies
I will trample it and call the
rain
I'll make no compromise
Roots of lies i'll eradicate
