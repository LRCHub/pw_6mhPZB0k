Don't you think about me enough?
I've been burning my heart out
I've got to face, need to tell
you
I won't run because I'm reticent
You will know you're reborn
tonight
Must be ragged but I stay by
your side
Even if my body's bleached to
the bones
I don't want to go through that
ever again
So cry no more, oh my beloved
Go ahead, be proud and fight it
out
You are the ONE, our rising star
You guide us far to home yet
